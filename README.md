# TKinterQuiz
A class that can build quizzes via a json-like variable that will contain all the quiz information, like:
  
  Quiz name (the window name)
  Quiz icon (windows window icon)
  Quiz total questions
  Quiz question score
  And more!
  
Please keep in mind that if the question/answer is too big you will need to break lines (using """ to make multi-lines strings or break the line with \n)
also, this code isn't polished at all, so it might have some bugs, which you can report at the Issues tab!
